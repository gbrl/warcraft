rescue Introduce a SiegeEngine Unit. The SiegeEngine is very effective against buildings such as the Barracks. 
However, it is ineffective against other Units. (It can't attack them, as if they were dead.)

So unlike with Footman (whose attacks do a fraction of the damage they normally would,) a SiegeEngine does 2Ã— damage against a Barracks.

Also, SiegeEngines can attack other SiegeEngines even though they cannot attack any other Units (such as Peasants or Footmans.)
